Smart City Sensor Deployment
Smart City Sensor Deployment is a Python application that helps in deploying sensors in a smart city environment. This application allows users to load a map, input area dimensions, grid size, and sensor range, and visualize the deployment of sensors while avoiding water bodies detected on the map. The project uses CustomTkinter for a modern GUI and incorporates threading to keep the interface responsive during computation.

Features
Grid-Based Sensor Deployment: Deploy sensors in a grid pattern within the specified area.
Water Body Detection: Automatically detect water bodies on the map and avoid placing sensors on them.
Optimal Sensor Placement: If a sensor cannot be placed on a grid point, find the nearest valid position.
Interactive GUI: User-friendly interface for loading maps, entering parameters, and visualizing results.
Progress Bar: Visual feedback on the deployment process.
Visualization: Display deployed sensors on the map and show sensor distribution histograms.
Requirements
Python 3.6+
CustomTkinter
Pillow
Matplotlib
NumPy
OpenCV

Install the required packages:

pip install customtkinter Pillow matplotlib numpy opencv-python-headless

Run the application:
python index.py
Load a map:

Click the "Load Map" button and select an image file (JPEG, PNG, BMP, TIFF).
Enter parameters:

Area Width (meters): Enter the width of the area in meters.
Area Height (meters): Enter the height of the area in meters.
Grid Size (meters): Enter the grid size for sensor deployment.
Sensor Range (meters): Enter the sensor range in meters.
Deploy sensors:

Click the "Deploy Sensors" button to start the deployment process. A progress bar will indicate the progress.
Visualize results:

The application will display the map with deployed sensors and show histograms of the sensor distribution.
Example
Here is an example of how to use the application:

Run the application.
Load a map image of your city.
Enter the area dimensions (e.g., 1000 meters by 1000 meters).
Set the grid size to 100 meters.
Set the sensor range to 50 meters.
Click "Deploy Sensors" to see the results.
Code Overview
app.py
The main application script that sets up the GUI and handles the sensor deployment logic.

Key Classes and Methods
SensorDeploymentApp(ctk.CTk): The main application class.
__init__: Initializes the GUI components.
load_map: Loads the map image.
start_deployment: Starts the sensor deployment in a separate thread.
deploy_sensors: Deploys sensors on the grid while avoiding water bodies.
find_closest_valid_position: Finds the nearest valid position if a sensor cannot be placed on a grid point.
show_deployment_results: Displays the deployment results on the map.
plot_sensor_distribution: Plots histograms of the sensor distribution.
Future Enhancements
Performance Optimization: Improve the efficiency of the sensor deployment algorithm.
Enhanced Visualization: Add more detailed visualization options such as heatmaps or 3D representations.
Advanced Features: Incorporate machine learning to predict optimal sensor placement based on various factors (e.g., population density, traffic patterns).
Real-time Updates: Implement real-time updates and feedback during sensor deployment.
User Feedback: Add more detailed error messages and confirmations to improve user interaction.
